	* Set the immutable flag on the block and character device so that
		e2fsck notices them as bad devices, and offers to fix them.
		E2fsck currently only checks devices with the immutable
		flag set, since otherwise there might be some false
		positives --- the kernel doesn't always clear the all of
		i_blocks[n], n>=4, due to a race condition.
