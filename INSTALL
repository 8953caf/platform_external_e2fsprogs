	To install the second extended file system management program,
just follow the steps:

1) Edit the file MCONFIG

	This file contains definitions used in the various makefiles.  These
definitions have reasonable default value but you may want to adjust them to 
your system configuration.

	In particular, if you don't have the tools to build shared
libraries, you'll want to comment out the "BUILD_DLL_SHLIBS = YES"
line.

2) Compile the programs

	Run `make world' to (a) create the dependencies files, (b)
compile the libraries and the programs, and (c) run a test suite on
e2fsck.  The test suite runs a series of tests; for each one, e2fsck
should return an exit status of 1 on the first pass, and an exit
status of 0 on the second pass.  The one exception to this is the
"okgroup.img" test, which should return an exit status of 0 for both
passes.

3) Install the programs

	Run `make install'

4) Install the include files and libraries

	You can run `make install-libs' to install the include files and
libraries.  Please note that this installation is not needed for the
programs to work.  It is only needed if you expect to develop other
programs using the libraries or if you want to compile other program
using these libraries (like the 4.4BSD dump and restore port).

5) Remove any pre-formatted man pages.  Some distributions will have
pre-formatted manual pages which will always be displayed in
preference to newer man pages in /usr/man.  If this is the case, you
may need to manually remove them in order to see the correct manual
pages.  The shell script in install-utils/remove_preformat_manpages
may be helpful in doing so.

5) Make sure your /etc/fstab file is correct.

	Some distributions install an /etc/fstab which is missing the
fifth and sixth field of filesystem entry, which are the dump
frequency, and the fsck pass number, respectively.  The problem with
this is that the getmntent() library routine interprets those missing
fields as "0", and a pass number of 0 is documented as meaning that
fsck should not check that particular filesystem.  If your entries in
your /etc/fstab file look liks this:

/dev/hda4       /        ext2        defaults

you should add "1 1" at the end of each line, so that they look like this:

/dev/hda4       /        ext2        defaults	1	1

	There is a script in insatll-utils/convfstab (donated by
Michael Weller) that may help you correct your /etc/fstab file.
