User request:

BTW: Could you please add some sort of deleted and possibly corrupted file
     and inode list to e2fsck report. There should be filenames deleted
     from directory inodes, files with duplicate blocks e.t.c.
     It's pretty annoying to filter this information from e2fsck output
     by hand :-(
