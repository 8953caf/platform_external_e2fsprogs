	* Makefile.dll-lib (jump): For each of the libraries jump/jump.*
	        files are now in in dll/jump.*; now the subdirs target
	        takes care of creating the jump directory, and then copy
	        the jump.* files from the dll directory to the jump
	        directory.  This allows dll libraries to be built where
		the build directory is not equal to the source directory.
