.TH UUID_GENERATE 3 "@E2FSPROGS_MONTH@ @E2FSPROGS_YEAR@" "E2fsprogs version @E2FSPROGS_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
uuid_generate \- create a new unique UUID value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <uuid/uuid.h>
.sp
.BI "void uuid_generate(uuid_t " out );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B uuid_generate
function creates a new universally unique identifier.  Depending on
compile\- and run\-time availability, the UUID will be based on the
local ethernet MAC address (if available), random data from /dev/urandom
or a pseudo\-random generator
.BR rand "(3) or " random "(3),"
and the current time.
.sp
The UUID is 16 bytes (128 bits) long, which gives approximately 3.4x10^38
unique values (there are approximately 10^80 elemntary particles in
the universe according to Carl Sagan's
.IR Cosmos ).
The new UUID can reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created
on the local system, and among UUIDs created on other systems in the past
and in the future.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The newly created UUID is returned in the memory location pointed to by
.IR out .
