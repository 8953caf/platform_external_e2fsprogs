	* blkid.h, blkidP.h, cache.c, dev.c, devname.c, devno.c, probe.c,
		probe.h, read.c, resolve.c, save.c, tag.c: Wholesale
		changes to library to simplify the implementation and
		shrink its size.  Change library version to be 1.0.

2003-01-27  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* read.c (parse_tag): Do not return that blkid_tag when parsing
		the blkid.tag file.

	* resolve.c (blkid_get_token, blkid_get_tagname_devname): Fold in
		code from removed functions

	* tag.c (blkid_create_tag): Don't return the newly tag strcture
		any more, as it's not needed.
		(blkid_find_tag_cache, blkid_get_tag_cache,
		 blkid_token_to_tag, blkid_find_tv_tags): Remove these 
		functions, as they are either only used once or have
		interfaces that should be deprecated.
		(blkid_find_tag_dev, blkid_find_head_cache): Replace use
		of blkid_tag with one or two const char * type/value
		arguments.
		(blkid_find_dev_with_tag): Fold in code from removed functions

	* probe.h, probe.c: Use a more sophisticated set of byte-swapping
		routines which are more compact and efficient.  Drop
		calculation of bid_free, since it's unnecessary.  Avoid 

	* save.c (blkid_save_cache): Set the permissions on the blkid
		cache file to 644.

	* cache.c, dev.c, devname.c, devno.c, getsize.c, llseek.c, 
		probe.c, probe.h, read.c, resolve.c, save.c, tag.c, 
		blkid.h, blkidP.h: Separate public and private
		interfaces into separate header files.  Start
		separating internal implementation details from the
		publically exported interface.

	* devname.c: Add support for EVMS

	* blkid.h, cache.c, dev.c, devname.c, devno.c, probe.c, probe.h,
		read.c, resolve.c, save.c, tag.c: Fix gcc -Wall nits.

2003-01-24  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* save.c (blkid_save_cache): Use mkstemp() instead mktemp().

2002-10-04  Jordan Breeding  <jordan.breeding@attbi.com>

	* Forward port to e2fsprogs 1.30

2001-09-20  Andreas Dilger  <adilger@turbolinux.com>

	* Initial release of libblkid.
