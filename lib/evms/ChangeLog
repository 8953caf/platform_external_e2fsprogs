	* fs_ext2.c, fsimext2.c: Synchronize with EVMS CVS tree.
		Fixed up confusion caused by bad parameter names for
		get_fs_limits().  Added missing conversion of
		volume->vol_size from sectors to bytes.  Fix up error 
		returns for unsupported tasks as EINVAL, not ENOSYS.
		Use logical names for the API version numbers, since 
		the ABI is much more dependent on the headers.  Add
		code to byte-swap the superblock if necessary.

	* common.h, dlist.h, enginestructs.h, options.h, plugfuncs.c, 
		fs_ext2.c: Synchronize with ABI of EVMS 1.1.

	* fs_ext2.c (fs_init_task): Fix minor bugs pointed out by Steve
		Pratt.  Fixed a selection bug and added checks to make
		sure volumes are not mounted when creating the list of
		volumes which can be mkfs'ed by the ext2/3 plugin.

2002-05-28    <tytso@thunk.org>

	* fsimext2.c: Log the fsck and mke2fs command lines.  Return
		appropriate volume limits so that resizing will work
		correctly.  Fix bug in how the e2fsck output was presented
		to the user.

	* fs_ext2.c: Add support for expanding and shrinking ext2/3
		filesystems.
