	* ext2ed.h: Remove VAR_DIR, and replace it with ETC_DIR.
		(/var/lib is no longer a politically correct location for
		application files according to the FHS).  Change include
		file location of ncurses.h to be /usr/include/ncurses.h.

	* init.c: Look for the configuration file in ETC_DIR/ext2ed.conf

	* Makefile.in: Integrate into the e2fsprogs makefile structure

	* ext2ed.conf.in, ext2ed.8.in: Change to be generated files, so
		that the pathnames in the man page and config file match
		the values chosen by the configure script.
