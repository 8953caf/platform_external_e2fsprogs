	* win.c, main.c, general_com.c: Use e2fsprogs's version
		information for the program banner.

	* ext2ed.h, init.c, general_com.c: Add a field_type parameter, and
		use specialized routines for showing and setting ints, uints,
		and characeter strings.

	* ext2.descriptors: Updated with newer superblock descriptor; use
		__u32 and __u16 instead of unsigned long and unsigned
		short.  Add data structures for direcctory indexing code.

	* ext2ed.h: Remove VAR_DIR, and replace it with ETC_DIR.
		(/var/lib is no longer a politically correct location for
		application files according to the FHS).  Change include
		file location of ncurses.h to be /usr/include/ncurses.h.

	* init.c: Look for the configuration file in ETC_DIR/ext2ed.conf

	* Makefile.in: Integrate into the e2fsprogs makefile structure

	* ext2ed.conf.in, ext2ed.8.in: Change to be generated files, so
		that the pathnames in the man page and config file match
		the values chosen by the configure script.
