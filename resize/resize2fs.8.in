.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B resize2fs 
program will resize ext2 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or
shrink an ext2 file system so that it will have 
.I size 
blocks.
The device containing the ext2 filesystem is specified by the 
.I device
parameter.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-d debug-flags
Turns on various resize2fs debugging features.  
.I debug-flags
should be computed by adding the numbers of the desired features 
from the following list:
.br
\	1\	\-\ Print out all disk I/O 
.br
\	2\	\-\ Debug block relocations
.br
\	8\	\-\ Debug inode relocations
.br
\	16\	\-\ Debug moving the inode table
.TP
.I \-p
Prints out a percentage completion bars for each 
.B resize2fs
operation, so that the user can keep track of what
the program is doing.
.TP 
.I \-F
Flush the filesystem device's buffer caches before beginning.  Only
really useful for doing 
.B resize2fs
time trials.
