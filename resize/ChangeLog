	* main.c (check_mount, main): Resize2fs now checks the size of the
		partition, and uses this as a default new_size of the
		partition if one is not specified.  Resize2fs will not let
		you resize a mounted partition.

	* resize2fs.c: Change how the progress function for the INODE_SCAN
		pass is performed, so that the maximum size is never zero.

	* resize2fs.8.in: Updated man page.

	* resize2fs.c, resize2fs.h, main.c, ext2_block_move.c,
	 	ext2_inode_move.c: Major reoganization of how resizing
	 	works.  Functions in ext2_block_move.c, and
	 	ext2_inode_move.c moved into resize2fs.c.  Multiple passes
	 	in those two files also combined into a single inode
	 	scanning pass.  Made the inode table moving function
	 	better handling the case where it needs to abort
	 	mid-operation.  When moving blocks around, made the block
	 	allocation function preferentially avoid the old group
	 	descriptor blocks, to make resize2fs more robust.

	* resize2fs.c, resize2fs.h, ext2_block_move.c, ext2_inode_move.c,
	 	main.c: Reorganize how the progress functions are called.

Mon Jan 19 09:12:28 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* resize2fs.h: If EXT2_FLAT_INCLUDES is defined, then assume all
 		of the ext2-specific header files are in a flat directory.

	* ext2_block_move.c, ext2_inode_move.c, extent.c, resize2fs.c,
 		resize2fs.h: Rename variables named "new" to "new_block",
 		"new_inode", or "new_loc" to avoid C++ reserved word
 		clash.
	
	* ext2_block_move.c, ext2_inode_move.c, extent.c, resize2fs.c,
 		sim_progress.c: Use ext2fs_get_memory(),
 		ext2fs_free_memory(), et. al., instead of malloc() and
 		free().
	
	* ext2_block_move.c, ext2_inode_move.c, extent.c: Explicitly cast
	 	all assignments from void * to be compatible with C++.
	
Mon Dec 29 19:09:45 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* banalysis.c, banalysis.h, ext2_inode_move.c, ext2_block_move.c:
		Change private to priv_data to avoid C++ namespace clash.

Mon Nov  3 14:45:06 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* resize2fs.h: Remove STDC magic, since everyone is STDC these days.

	* resize2fs.c, ext2_block_move.c ext2_inode_move.c: Only include
		printf statements if RESIZE2FS_DEBUG is defined.

	* main.c: Don't read in the bitmaps since resize2fs.c does that.

Sun Oct 19 20:40:42 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* resize2fs.h: Add #ifdef's for HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H and HAVE_SYS_TIME_H.

Wed Sep  3 17:31:49 1997  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@edt.mit.edu>

	* resize2fs.h: Add #include for errno.h

Tue Jun 17 01:33:20 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.11
