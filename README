	This is the new version (1.12) of the second extended file system
management programs.

	Note: If you are using the RedHat RPM distributions of
e2fsprogs, don't worry about the next paragraph; all others, please
read on!

	See the file INSTALL for instructions on building and
installing e2fsprogs.  This is important!  Note that your /etc/fstab
file may need modifying before you install the new fsck program.  See
the INSTALL file for more details.

	In case of bugs in these programs, please contact Ted Ts'o
<tytso@mit.edu>.  See the e2fsck man page for suggestions of what sort
of information to include when submitting bug reports for e2fsck.
