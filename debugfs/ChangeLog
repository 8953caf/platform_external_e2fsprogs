		to see if the usage message should be printed.

	* debugfs.c (do_open_filesys): Change to always set optreset to 1,

	* debugfs.c (do_find_free_block, do_find_free_inode): Fix bug in

		<getopt.h> if it doesn't exist.

Sun Jun 11 15:21:07 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* ncheck.c (do_ncheck): Use LINUX_S_ISDIR instead of S_ISDIR
