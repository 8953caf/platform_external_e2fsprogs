.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI tune2fs
adjusts tunable filesystem parameters on a Linux second extended filesystem.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c " max-mount-counts"
adjust the maximal mounts count between two filesystem checks.  If 
.I max-mount-counts
is -1 then the number of times the filesystem is mounted will be disregarded
by e2fsck and the kernel.
.TP
.BI \-e " error-behavior"
change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are detected.
.I error-behavior
can be one of the following:
.br
\	continue\	\	Continue normal execution.
.br
\	remount-ro\	Remount filesystem read-only.
.br
\	panic\	\	Cause a kernel panic.
.TP
.BI \-g " group"
set the user group which can benefit from the reserved blocks.
.br
.I group
can be a numerical gid or a group name.  If a group name is given,
it is converted to a numerical gid before it is stored in the superblock.
.TP
.BI \-i " interval-between-checks\fR[\fBd\fR|\fBm\fR|\fBw\fR]"
adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks. 
No postfix or
.B d
result in days,
.B m
in months, and
.B w
in weeks.  A value of zero will disable the timedependent checking.
.TP
.B -j
Add an ext3 journal to the filesystem.
If the 
.B \-J
option is not specified, the default journal parameters will used will create
an appropriately sized journal (given the size of the filesystem) 
stored within the filesystem.
.TP
.BR \-J " journal_options"
add a journal inode or device to the filesystem.  
Journal options are comma
separated, and may take an argument using the equals ('=')  sign.
Currently only two (mutually exclusive) options are supported,
.I size
and
.IR device .
.TP
.BI "\-J size=" journal-size
Create a journal stored in the filesystem of size
.IR journal-size .
The size of the journal must be between 1MB and 100MB and there 
must be sufficient free space in the filesystem to create a journal of
that size.
.TP
.BI "\-J device=" external-journal
Add an external journal found on a block device
named by 
.I external-journal 
to the filesystem.
The external 
journal must have been already created using the command
.B mke2fs -O journal_dev 
.IR journal-device.
.TP
.B \-l
list the contents of the filesystem superblock.
.TP
.BI \-m " reserved-blocks-percentage"
adjust the reserved blocks percentage on the given device.
.TP
.BI \-r " reserved-blocks-count"
adjust the reserved blocks count on the given device.
.TP
.BI \-s " sparse_super_flag"
set or reset the sparse_superblock flag.  The sparse_super feature
saves space on really big filesystems.
.B Warning:
The Linux kernels before 2.0.39 do not support this feature.  Neither do
all Linux 2.1 kernels; please don't use this unless you know what you're
doing!
.TP
.BI \-u " user"
set the user who can benefit from the reserved blocks.
.I user
can be a numerical uid or a user name.  If a user name is given, it 
is converted to a numerical uid before it is stored in the superblock.
.TP
.BI \-C " mount-count"
set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted.
.TP
.BI \-L " volume-label"
set the volume label of the filesystem.  
Ext2 filesystem labels can be at most 16 characters long; if
.I volume-label 
is longer than 16 characters, 
.B tune2fs
will truncate it and print a warning message.  
.TP
.BI \-M " last-mounted-directory"
set the last-mounted directory for the filesystem.
.TP
.BI \-O " \fR[^]\fIfeature\fR[,...]"
set or clear the indicated filesystem features (options) in the filesystem.
.I Feature
can be one of the following supported filesystem options: 
.IR sparse_super ,
which will cause the filesystem to use sparse superblocks, and
.IR filetype ,
which will cause the filesystem to store file type information in 
directory entries.  After setting or clearing either filesystem feature,
e2fsck must be run on the filesystem.
.TP
.BI \-U " UUID"
set the UUID of the filesystem.  A sample UUID looks like this: 
"c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".  The uuid may also be
.IR null ,
which will set the filesystem UUID to the null UUID (clearing it), 
.IR random ,
which will generate a new random-based UUID for the filesystem, or
.IR time ,
which will generate a new time-based UUID for the filesystem (see
.BR uuidgen (8)).
.SH BUGS
We haven't found any bugs yet.  That doesn't mean there aren't any...
.SH WARNING
Never use tune2fs to change parameters of a read/write mounted filesystem!
.B Use this utility
.B at your own risk.
You're modifying a filesystem!
